# ResearchDataFinder
Enterprise knowledge and data discovery platform enabling scalable reuse of research datasets, benchmarks, and analytics across global teams.

## Overview
Research Data Finder is an enterprise-scale knowledge and data discovery platform
designed to enable consultants and research teams to efficiently find, access, and
reuse structured and unstructured research datasets, benchmarks, and insights.

## The Problem
Research data and insights were fragmented across tools, teams, and geographies.
This led to duplicated effort, inconsistent use of existing data, and significant
time spent searching for relevant research assets instead of generating insights.

## Scope & Scale
- Enterprise-wide platform supporting multiple practices
- Global user base across regions
- Integrated structured and unstructured research data

## My Role
Product Owner and Project Lead responsible for end-to-end delivery, stakeholder
alignment, and adoption of the platform.

## Solution
- Defined a unified discovery experience for research and analytics assets
- Established metadata, taxonomy, and governance standards
- Enabled search and filtering across datasets, benchmarks, and insights
- Integrated with existing research and analytics workflows

## Outcomes
- Reduced time spent searching for research data
- Increased reuse of existing datasets and benchmarks
- Improved consistency and quality of insights delivered to stakeholders

##Measures of Success
- Increased research content usage from 33% to 38% through improved discoverability
- Improved Power BI platform adoption from 32% to 55% by enabling easier access to curated datasets
- Increased reuse of existing research assets from 45% to 72%, reducing duplicated effort
- Improved daily active usage, representing a ~40% increase in DAU through workflow-aligned access

## Key Learnings
- Knowledge platforms fail without strong governance and ownership
- Adoption depends as much on workflows as on technology
- Metadata quality is critical to long-term platform value

## Architecture (High Level)
- Centralized data lake and curated data warehouse serving as the system of record
- Metadata and taxonomy layer for standardized classification of research assets
- Vector database built on Azure to support semantic and contextual search
- LLM-enabled contextual search and natural language querying (NLQ) over research content
- Custom-built application layer for search, discovery, and user interaction
- Integrated usage analytics and monitoring to track adoption and engagement
- Governance and access controls to ensure data quality, security, and compliance
