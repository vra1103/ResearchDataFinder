# ResearchDataFinder
Enterprise knowledge and data discovery platform enabling scalable reuse of research datasets, benchmarks, and analytics across global teams.

## Overview
Research Data Finder is an enterprise-scale knowledge and data discovery platform
designed to enable consultants and research teams to efficiently find, access, and
reuse structured and unstructured research datasets, benchmarks, and insights.

## The Problem
Research data and insights were fragmented across tools, teams, and geographies.
This led to duplicated effort, inconsistent use of existing data, and significant
time spent searching for relevant research assets instead of generating insights.

## Scope & Scale
- Enterprise-wide platform supporting multiple practices
- Global user base across regions
- Integrated structured and unstructured research data

## My Role
Product Owner and Project Lead responsible for end-to-end delivery, stakeholder
alignment, and adoption of the platform.

## Solution
- Defined a unified discovery experience for research and analytics assets
- Established metadata, taxonomy, and governance standards
- Enabled search and filtering across datasets, benchmarks, and insights
- Integrated with existing research and analytics workflows

## Outcomes
- Reduced time spent searching for research data
- Increased reuse of existing datasets and benchmarks
- Improved consistency and quality of insights delivered to stakeholders

## Key Learnings
- Knowledge platforms fail without strong governance and ownership
- Adoption depends as much on workflows as on technology
- Metadata quality is critical to long-term platform value
